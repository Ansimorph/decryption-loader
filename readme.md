# Decryption Loader

Decrypt assets that where encrypted with [node-cipher](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-cipher).

## Why?

If your public repository includes files you can't share with the world, one solution is to encrypt them. [node-cipher](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-cipher) is a node-based cli for this purpose. Decryption-loader allows you to decrypt these assets at build-time.

## Install

```bash
npm install decryption-loader
```
